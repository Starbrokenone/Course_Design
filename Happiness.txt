What Is Happiness
Most of us probably don¡¯t believe we need a formal definition of happiness; we know it
 when we feel it, and we often use the term to describe a range of positive emotions, 
including joy, pride, contentment, and gratitude.
But to understand the causes and effects of happiness, researchers first need to define 
it. Many of them use the term interchangeably with ¡°subjective well-being,¡± which they 
measure by simply asking people to report how satisfied they feel with their own lives and 
how much positive and negative emotion they¡¯re experiencing. In her 2007 book The How 
of Happiness, positive psychology researcher Sonja Lyubomirsky elaborates, describing 
happiness as ¡°the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well being, combined with a 
sense that one¡¯s life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.¡±
That definition resonates with us here at Greater Good: It captures the fleeting positive 
emotions that come with happiness, along with a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in 
life and suggests how these emotions and sense of meaning reinforce one another.
